# MulticloudAnalyticsDemo

## Description and Need
Today, customer data typically resides in a range of disparate locations including multiple clouds and on-prem systems. Customers lack two key capabilities: 1) the ability to easily analyze disparate siloed data where it resides and 2) conduct multi-cloud data analysis with a common suite of person-driven tools. GCP is uniquely positioned to address this industry need. 

## Approach
In this presentation, we seek to demonstrate the following: 1) GCP client leverages a a single pane of glass to seamlessly access, query, and centralize insights based on data residing in Google Cloud, other clouds, snowflake and on-prem environments; without writing any code 2) Quant persona at the same client conducts predictive analysis on the same data leveraging GCP’s AI/ML capabilities  

## Benefits
* Break down data silos and get insights faster by taking compute to the data in other clouds
* Respect the customer; no data movement across clouds
* Multi-cloud data analysis using a single control plane
* Use standard SQL to write queries and build dashboards
* Instant query returns instant results
* Query results are transported across clouds without moving source data in other clouds; Query results are always fresh; results are not cached
* Zero code data pipelines import data from Snowflake and on-prem MySQL/Oracle databases
* Focus on usage of data assets over moving data assets to create value
* Support multiple usage personas
* Next generation enabled; AI at your door

## Why Google - Differentiator
* Google is the only cloud provider with products for multi-cloud analytics
* Facilitates the application of GCP’s data analytics tools to data irrespective of the location
* Automate sourcing of data held in disparate repositories such as on-prem or snowflake without writing code
* Complete analytics platform: sourcing, storage, and insights for all personas
